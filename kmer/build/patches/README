This is the patch that gmake-3.80 needs to make it work with this build system.
You can get it from http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=1517

To build a patched gmake:

Get make-3.80.tar.[gz|bz2] from http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/

Uncompress and untar that.

cd make-3.80
patch < ../eval-crash.diff
sh configure
make

Then copy the 'make' executabe somewhere in your path.  You may want
to call it 'gmake', which I know works, or you may want to call it
something else, which might work.
