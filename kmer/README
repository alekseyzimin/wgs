How to build:

----------
0)  Required software

Project kmer requires two additional software packages be installed:
python and gmake.

0.1)  Python.

Python (http://www.python.org/) is a freely available programming
language.  It is frequently installed by many OS installations.

Version 2.4 is recommended.
Version 2.3 has seen limited testing and seems to work.
Version 2.2 might work, but is unsupported.

Python is only needed by ATAC/A2Amapper.  If python is not installed,
ATAC/A2Amapper will not be built.

0.2)  gmake.

The GNU make program (gmake) is used to build the software.  The BSD
make will not work.

Version 3.81 is strongly recommended.
Version 3.80 works, but needs to be patched.  See build/patches/README.

----------
1)  Create machine dependent configuration files.

% sh configure.sh

Supplying 'debug' as an argument will build debuggable executables.

If configure.sh reports that your architecture is unsupported, you'll
have to port...or force it to use, say, linux with "configure.sh
linux".

If configure.sh reports that python cannot be found, you likely need
to install python, version 2.3 or 2.4.  If you have pyhton installed
in an unusual location, edit the script.

----------
2)  Build

% gmake

If this crashes or returns
        gmake: *** No rule to make target `.all', needed by `all'.  Stop.
then you unfortunately need to update your gmake to version 3.81, or
you can patch version 3.80 using the directions in
build/patches/README

----------
3)  Install things, other build targets

A 'make install' will copy all the executables into an architecture
specific 'bin' directory, for example, into freebsd/bin or linux/bin.
ESTmapper and ATAC/A2Amapper are NOT installed by this process.

To install ESTmapper, 'cd ESTmapper && sh install.sh location'.  This
will copy the ESTmapper binaries to 'location/bin' and 'location/lib'.

To install ATAC/A2Amapper, 'cd atac-driver && sh install.sh location'.
This will copy the ATAC/A2Amapper binaries to 'location/bin' and
'location/lib'.

----------
4)  Other build targets

A 'make clean' will remove the object files, leaving the binaries.

A 'make real-clean' will remove all traces of a build, leaving you
with only a few files more than a freshly checked out copy.
